# angular-ui

Directives and filters taken directly from https://github.com/angular-ui/

Since we're already in the "overkill" range with the sheer size of our javascript (~500kb at the time of this writing), I simply didn't want to include the entire angular-ui package, so I'm taking the bits and pieces (as with bootstrap) that we want to use.

At some point, we'll have to use a loader..

Directory structure here mimics the angular-ui project.
