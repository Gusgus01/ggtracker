/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into gg.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Note: we are including almost anything inside all.css.scss, as we want 
 * macros/functions/etc to be inherited, which sprocket (the asset pipeline)
 * will not make possible. If we would instead use this manifest, we'd have
 * the same includes and declarations in every single scss file.
